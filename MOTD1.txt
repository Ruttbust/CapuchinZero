Capuchin is getting a remake and shall be done in 1-4 months. Photon has been disabled therefore, you cannot see other people or talk to other people. The reason we did this, is since we're not making any income, every month we have to pay for photon it's just draining money. Eventually we're not going to have enough to pay for it. But we do still need to pay for the remake. I hope you all understand
